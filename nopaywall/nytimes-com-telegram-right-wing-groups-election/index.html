 backing former President Donald J. Trump recently sent messages to 
organize poll watchers to be ready to dispute votes in Democratic areas.
 Some posted images of armed men standing up for their rights to recruit
 for their cause. Others spread conspiracy theories that anything less 
than a Trump victory on Tuesday would be a miscarriage of justice worthy
 of revolt.</p><p>“The day is fast approaching when fence sitting will 
no longer be possible,” read one post from an Ohio chapter of the Proud 
Boys, the far-right organization that was instrumental in the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/news-event/jan-6-committee" title="">Jan. 6 attack</a>
 on the Capitol. “You will either stand with the resistance or take a 
knee and willingly accept the yoke of tyranny and oppression.”</p><p>The messages were all posted on <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/07/technology/telegram-crime-terrorism.html" title="">Telegram</a>,
 the lightly moderated social media platform with nearly one billion 
users, which has become a harbinger of the potential actions and chaos 
that could unfold on Election Day and after. More so than other social 
apps, Telegram is a prime organizing tool for extremists, who have a 
tendency to turn digital coordination into real-world action.</p><p>A 
New York Times analysis of more than one million messages across nearly 
50 Telegram channels with over 500,000 members found a sprawling and 
interconnected movement intended to question the credibility of the 
presidential election, interfere with the voting process and potentially
 dispute the outcome. Nearly every channel reviewed by The Times was 
created after the 2020 election, highlighting the growth and increased 
sophistication of the election denialism movement.</p></div><div data-testid="companionColumn-1"><p>The
 Times reviewed messages from “election integrity” groups across a dozen
 states, including battlegrounds like Pennsylvania, Georgia, Wisconsin, 
North Carolina and Michigan. Their posts overwhelmingly spewed 
disinformation and conspiracy theories and featured violent imagery.</p><p>More
 than 4,000 of their posts went further by encouraging members to act by
 attending local election meetings, joining protest rallies and making 
financial donations, the analysis found. Posts from other right-wing 
groups reviewed by The Times urged followers to be prepared for 
violence. These calls to action extended the right-wing language 
typically found on other major social media sites into the physical 
world.</p><p aria-live="polite" role="note"><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/subscription?campaignId=8WXW7">Subscribe to The Times</a> to read as many articles as you like.</p></div></section><div><div><p><strong>A correction was made on</strong></p><p>Nov. 4, 2024</p><p>:&nbsp;</p><p>An
